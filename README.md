# COSC213---Final-Project
Final Project
 Project 3: Online Booking System
Overview: A web application for scheduling appointments or reserving resources. Examples: a tutoring center, a meeting room reservation system, or a service appointment booking site.

Core Requirements:

Service/Resource Listing: A public page displaying the bookable services or resources with descriptions and availability.

Calendar Interface: A visual calendar (e.g., a weekly or monthly grid) that displays available and booked time slots.

Booking Form: An intuitive form for users to select a service, date, and time, and to enter their name and email to make a booking.

Admin Panel (Bookings): A password-protected dashboard where an administrator can view all upcoming and past bookings in a list or calendar format. The admin must be able to approve or cancel bookings.

Automated Email Confirmation: Upon a successful booking, the system must send a confirmation email to the user's provided email address.

Availability Logic: The system must prevent double-booking of the same time slot for a given resource.

Advanced Features (Choose at least two for an 'A' grade):

User Accounts: Allow users to register and log in to view their own booking history and manage their upcoming appointments.

Multiple Resources/Staff: Extend the system to handle bookings for multiple resources or staff members (e.g., different tutors, different rooms), each with their own unique schedule.

Recurring Bookings: Allow users or admins to create recurring appointments (e.g., weekly).

Automated Email Reminders: Implement a system to send an automated reminder email to the user 24 hours before their scheduled appointment.

User-Managed Cancellations: Allow logged-in users to cancel their own appointments up to a certain time before the appointment.
