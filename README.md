# COSC213---Final-Project
Final Project
 Project 3: Online Booking System
Overview: A web application for scheduling appointments or reserving resources. Examples: a tutoring center, a meeting room reservation system, or a service appointment booking site.

Core Requirements:

Service/Resource Listing: A public page displaying the bookable services or resources with descriptions and availability.

Calendar Interface: A visual calendar (e.g., a weekly or monthly grid) that displays available and booked time slots.

Booking Form: An intuitive form for users to select a service, date, and time, and to enter their name and email to make a booking.

Admin Panel (Bookings): A password-protected dashboard where an administrator can view all upcoming and past bookings in a list or calendar format. The admin must be able to approve or cancel bookings.

Automated Email Confirmation: Upon a successful booking, the system must send a confirmation email to the user's provided email address.

Availability Logic: The system must prevent double-booking of the same time slot for a given resource.

Advanced Features (Choose at least two for an 'A' grade):

User Accounts: Allow users to register and log in to view their own booking history and manage their upcoming appointments.

User-Managed Cancellations: Allow logged-in users to cancel their own appointments up to a certain time before the appointment.

Project Title: [INSERT HOTEL/SERVICE NAME HERE]
By: Rylan, Connor and Samuel
Description: Our project is a hotel/booking service site. The purpose of it is to have users log in and be able to schedule any of the 5 rooms between a specific time. Guests and users are able to view the calender and the admin has the ability to remove any listing at any time. Users also have the ability to cancel their booking up to 24 hours before their appointment. Guests do not have permission to access the schedule_stay and cancel_booking sessions and will be redirected back to the login screen. Any of these types of users are able to create a new account that will be given the same permissions as a regular user account.

Development Environment Instructions: Download all php files and start at the login page. sql.txt has the tables that need to be imported.
